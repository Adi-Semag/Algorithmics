Automated Data Fusion

Overview:
The focus of our project is to combine optical, radar, and LiDAR data in order to improve terrain mapping and create more accurate 3D models. Our objective is to develop comprehensive and precise models of geographic areas by merging these diverse datasets, each of which provides distinct perspectives and detailed information.

Our methodology aims to address obstacles such as data integrity, alignment precision, and computational requirements by utilizing machine learning algorithms and specialized processing tools.

Problems to Overcome:
Misalignment: Manual processes are prone to errors in aligning data from different sources.
Inconsistencies: Variations in data quality and format lead to inconsistencies in the final dataset.
Time-Consuming: Manual integration is labor-intensive and time-consuming.
Scalability Issues: Difficult to scale for large datasets or multiple sources.

How to Run:
Run in terminal : `python app.py`
Frontend is stored in in "templates" folder
Flask web app is implemented
